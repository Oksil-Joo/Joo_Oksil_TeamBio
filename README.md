# Team-bio Project.
This is a `Balla team page`. I work on the project alone, so the team member is alone. Therefore, I'd like to introduce the team by dividing the design and development fields.

### To run
The index.html file must be executed to watch the team page.

### Reason for Application
The team-bio project designed using java script. I have to introduce with a responsive web page.


### Colors

### AUTHORS
Designed and developed by Oksil Joo.

### Tools used
* a responsive html5
* CSS3(using CSS Grid)
* Java Script
* Markdown
